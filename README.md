## What is Nix?

Nix is a powerful package manager and system configuration tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration. It ensures that installing or upgrading one package cannot break other packages, enables multiple versions of a package to coexist, and makes it easy to roll back to previous versions.

### Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration**
  - Your entire system defined as code
  - Reproducible environments
  - Safe, atomic updates

### Why Use Nix?

- **For Developers**
  - Consistent development environments
  - Project-specific package versions
  - Easy sharing of development setups

- **For System Configuration**
  - Version control your entire system
  - Test changes safely
  - Roll back when needed

## Core Components

Each component serves a specific purpose in creating a reproducible system:

- **nix-darwin**: System-level macOS configuration
  - Manages macOS settings and preferences
  - Handles system-level packages
  - Controls system defaults and security

- **Home Manager**: User environment management
  - Manages user-specific configurations
  - Handles dotfiles and program settings
  - Ensures consistent user environment

- **Homebrew**: macOS package management
  - Manages GUI applications
  - Handles macOS-specific packages
  - Provides quick updates for certain tools

## Design Decisions

### Why Nix?

1. **Reproducibility**
    - Exact same setup across machines
    - Version-controlled configuration
    - Declarative system definition

2. **Modularity**
    - Separate system and user config
    - Easy to enable/disable features
    - Reusable configuration modules

3. **Reliability**
    - Atomic updates
    - Rollback capability
    - Consistent state management

4. **Performance Optimized**
    - Lazy loading for heavy functions
    - Streamlined configuration files
    - Fast shell startup times

### File Structure

The repository is organized into logical, optimized components:

- `darwin/` - System configuration
  - Separates macOS-specific settings
  - Manages system-wide packages
  - Controls security policies

- `home-manager/` - User environment (Optimized)
  - Modular program configurations with helper functions
  - Lazy-loaded AWS SSO functions for fast startup
  - Personal preferences and tools
  - Shell and terminal setup

- `nix/` - Core Nix setup
  - Basic Nix configuration
  - Shell integration
  - Dynamic configurations

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Apple Silicon - M*)
- Administrative access
- Basic terminal knowledge

## Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Command Setup (Automatic)

For a quick setup that proceeds automatically after 5 seconds:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlgruby/dotfile-nix/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Download and Run (Interactive)

For full interactive control with confirmation prompts:

```bash
curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlgruby/dotfile-nix/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This will automatically:

- Download the full installation script
- Perform system checks
- Ask for your preferred directory name (defaults to `dotfile`)
- Guide you through the complete setup process

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to do the setup manually:

1. **Install Command Line Tools**

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

1. **Clone Configuration**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/mlgruby/dotfile-nix.git dotfile
cd dotfile
```

1. **Configure User Settings**

```bash
cp user-config.template.nix user-config.nix
```

Edit `user-config.nix` with your information:

```nix
{
  username = "your-macos-username";  # Must match your macOS login
  fullName = "Your Full Name";
  email = "your.email@example.com";
  githubUsername = "your-github-username";
  hostname = "your-hostname";  # e.g., macbook-pro
}
```

1. **Run Installation**

This script automates the initial setup: installs Xcode tools (if needed), Homebrew, Nix, clones this repository if needed, sets up initial symlinks (including for a temporary shell environment from `nix/`), and performs the first system build using `nix-darwin`.

```bash
./scripts/install/pre-nix-installation.sh
```

After the script completes and the first build is successful, **open a new terminal window** for the fully configured environment managed by Home Manager to take effect.

## SSH Setup & Validation

The installation script includes intelligent SSH key management:

- **Detects existing SSH keys** and lets you choose which to use
- **Creates GitHub-specific key** at `~/.ssh/github` (via symlink or new key)
- **Automatically uploads** your public key to GitHub
- **Configures SSH properly** for seamless GitHub authentication

**Validate your SSH setup anytime:**

```bash
./validate-ssh.sh
```

This will check:

- SSH key existence and type
- SSH agent configuration
- GitHub connection status
- Home-manager SSH configuration
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

## GPG Setup for GitHub (Optional but Recommended)

For enhanced security and verified commits on GitHub, you can automatically set up GPG signing:

```bash
./scripts/setup/gpg-github.sh
```

This script will:

- ✅ Check if a GPG key already exists for your email
- ✅ Generate a new GPG key if needed (using secure defaults)
- ✅ Authenticate with GitHub (if not already done)
- ✅ Upload your public key to GitHub automatically
- ✅ Update your `user-config.nix` with the key ID
- ✅ Rebuild your configuration
- ✅ Test GPG signing functionality

**Prerequisites:**

- `user-config.nix` must be configured with your email
- GitHub CLI authentication (script will prompt if needed)

**After setup:**

- All your commits will be automatically signed
- GitHub will show "Verified" badges on your commits
- Your GPG key ID will be saved in `user-config.nix`

**Manual GitHub Authentication (if needed):**

```bash
gh auth login
```

**Example Output:**

```text

```

## Applying Changes

After the initial setup, to apply any changes you make to the configuration files in this repository, run the following command from the `~/Documents/dotfile` directory:

```bash
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#$(hostname)
# Or use the 'rebuild' alias (which includes sudo automatically)
rebuild
```

**Note:** The `sudo` is required due to recent nix-darwin updates that require system activation to run as root for security reasons.

## Directory Structure

```bash
dotfile/
├── flake.nix                   # Main configuration
├── flake.lock                  # Dependency lock file
├── user-config.template.nix    # User configuration template
├── setup.sh                    # Quick setup script
├── scripts/                    # Organized scripts
│   ├── install/
│   │   ├── pre-nix-installation.sh    # Installation script
│   │   └── uninstall.sh              # Uninstallation script
│   ├── setup/                        # Setup utilities
│   ├── monitoring/                   # System monitoring
│   └── utils/                        # Utility scripts
```

**Note on `nix/` Directory:** The files `nix/zshrc` and `nix/dynamic-config.zsh` are symlinked directly into `~/` by the `pre-nix-installation.sh` script. They provide a minimal, temporary shell environment immediately after the script finishes, before you open a new terminal. The full, robust shell environment is declaratively configured by Home Manager (`home-manager/modules/zsh.nix`) and takes effect in new terminal sessions after the first build.

## Acknowledgments

This configuration was developed with the assistance of [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), an AI-powered code editor that helped:

- Generate and structure configuration files
- Debug Nix expressions
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Maintain consistent code style

## Important Notes

-*   **Neovim:** The Neovim configuration (`home-manager/neovim.nix`) uses an activation script to bootstrap a [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) starter configuration into `~/.config/nvim` if that directory doesn't exist. Subsequent Neovim configuration changes should be made manually within `~/.config/nvim`. For a fully declarative setup, `programs.neovim` would need significant refactoring.
