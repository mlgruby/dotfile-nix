## Maintenance Tasks

### Automated Maintenance (Weekly)

The system performs these maintenance tasks every Sunday:

#### Nix Maintenance

- Garbage collection with performance optimization
- Store optimization and deduplication
- Store integrity verification

#### Homebrew Maintenance

- Package updates and upgrades
- Cleanup of old versions
- Health check (brew doctor)

#### System Cleanup

- Temporary file cleanup (files older than 7 days)
- User cache cleanup (files older than 30 days)
- Log file cleanup (files older than 30 days)

#### macOS Maintenance

- Spotlight index rebuilding
- DNS cache flushing

### Manual Maintenance

Run maintenance manually when needed:

```bash
# Full maintenance suite
health-maintain

# Individual maintenance components
./scripts/system-health-monitor.sh --maintain
```

## Configuration

### Threshold Configuration

Edit thresholds in `scripts/system-health-monitor.sh`:

```bash
# Health check thresholds
CPU_THRESHOLD=80        # CPU usage percentage
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=85     # Memory usage percentage  
DISK_THRESHOLD=90       # Disk usage percentage
LOAD_THRESHOLD=8        # Load average threshold
```

### Service Scheduling

Modify schedules in `darwin/system-monitoring.nix`:

```nix
StartCalendarInterval = [
  {
    Hour = 9;      # Change hour
    Minute = 0;    # Change minute
  }
];
```

### Log Configuration

Logs are stored in `~/.local/var/log/`:

- `system-health-check.log` - Daily health checks
- `system-maintenance.log` - Weekly maintenance tasks
- `performance-monitor.log` - Performance analysis
- `critical-alerts.log` - Critical issue alerts

## Reports and Analysis

### Health Reports

Generated reports are stored in `.health-reports/`:

- **health_report_TIMESTAMP.txt** - Comprehensive health reports
- **maintenance_TIMESTAMP.log** - Maintenance task logs

### Performance Reports

Performance analysis reports in `.performance-reports/`:

- **system_analysis_TIMESTAMP.txt** - System configuration analysis
- **rebuild_profile_TIMESTAMP.txt** - Build performance profiles
- **cache_analysis_TIMESTAMP.txt** - Binary cache performance

### Report Analysis

Review reports regularly:

```bash
# View latest health report
ls -la .health-reports/ | tail -5

# View latest performance report  
ls -la .performance-reports/ | tail -5

# Quick health status
health-check
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Issues

If monitoring services aren't running:

```bash
# Check service status
monitor-status

# Reload services
monitor-unload && monitor-load

# Check for errors
logs-health
```

### High Resource Usage

If system reports high resource usage:

1. **Check top processes**: Reports show top CPU/memory consumers
2. **Review maintenance**: Run `health-maintain` if maintenance is overdue
3. **Analyze trends**: Compare with previous reports
4. **Manual investigation**: Use `htop`, `activity monitor`

### Disk Space Issues

For disk space warnings:

1. **Run cleanup**: `health-maintain` includes comprehensive cleanup
2. **Check Nix store**: Large store size suggests need for garbage collection
3. **Manual cleanup**: Remove large files, empty trash
4. **Analyze usage**: Use `duf` or `du -sh *` to find large directories

### Network Issues

For connectivity problems:

1. **Check network settings**: Verify WiFi/Ethernet connection
2. **DNS issues**: Try alternative DNS servers
3. **Firewall**: Check macOS firewall settings
4. **VPN**: Verify VPN isn't causing issues

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-deployment Checks

Add health checks to your workflow:

```bash
# Before major system changes
health-check

# After system updates
health-report

# Monitor performance impact
perf-analyze
```

### Continuous Monitoring

The automated system provides:

- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch problems before they become critical
- **Performance Trending**: Track system performance over time
- **Maintenance Automation**: Keep system optimized without manual intervention
- **Development Environment Health**: Ensure development tools are functioning optimally

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Alerts

Extend the alert system by modifying `check_alerts()` in the monitoring script:

```bash
# Add custom critical checks
if custom_critical_condition; then
    log_error "CRITICAL: Custom condition detected"
    critical_issues=$((critical_issues + 1))
fi
```

### External Notifications

Integrate with notification systems:

```bash
# Add to check_alerts() function
if [ $critical_issues -gt 0 ]; then
    # Send Slack notification
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data '{"text":"System health critical issues detected"}' \
        YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
fi
```

### Monitoring Extensions

Add additional monitoring by extending the health check functions:

- Database connectivity monitoring
- External service health checks
- Application-specific monitoring
- Security scan integration

## Conclusion

The system health monitoring provides comprehensive oversight of your Nix Darwin environment with minimal manual intervention. Regular monitoring ensures optimal performance and early detection of potential issues.
