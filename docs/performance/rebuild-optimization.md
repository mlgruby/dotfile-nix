# Rebuild Performance Optimization

This document covers performance optimizations implemented to reduce Nix Darwin rebuild times and improve development workflow efficiency.

## Overview

The performance optimizations focus on three key areas:

1. **Build parallelization** - Maximum CPU core utilization
2. **Caching strategies** - Avoid rebuilding unchanged components
3. **Binary cache optimization** - Leverage remote caches effectively

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Nix Settings Optimizations

Enhanced settings in `darwin/nix-settings.nix`:

```nix
{
  nix.settings = {
    # Performance tuning
    max-jobs = "auto";          # Automatic job count based on CPU cores
    cores = 0;                  # Use all available cores per job
    
    # Build acceleration
    keep-derivations = true;    # Keep build dependencies for faster rebuilds
    keep-outputs = true;        # Keep build outputs to avoid rebuilds
    
    # Binary cache optimization
    substituters = [
      "https://cache.nixos.org/"
      "https://nix-community.cachix.org"
      "https://nixpkgs-unfree.cachix.org"
    ];
    
    # Auto-optimization (use nix.optimise.automatic instead of deprecated auto-optimise-store)
    # auto-optimise-store = true; # DEPRECATED - use nix.optimise.automatic instead
  };
}
```

### 2. Automated Maintenance

Daily automated tasks for optimal performance:

```nix
{
  # Garbage collection
  nix.gc = {
    automatic = true;
    interval = { Day = 1; };
    options = "--delete-older-than 7d";
  };
  
  # Store optimization for better performance
  nix.optimise = {
    automatic = true;
    interval = { Day = 1; }; # Daily store optimization
  };
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Build Aliases

Performance-optimized shell aliases:

```bash
# Standard rebuild with optimizations
rebuild        # darwin-rebuild switch with performance flags

# Maximum performance rebuild
rebuild-fast   # All optimization flags enabled

# Check before building
rebuild-check  # Dry-run to see what will be built
```

## Performance Analysis Tools

### Built-in Analysis Script

The system includes a comprehensive performance analysis tool:

```bash
# Basic system analysis
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh

# Profile rebuild performance
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --profile

# Analyze cache performance
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --cache

# Full performance report
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --report

# Apply optimizations
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --optimize
```

### Performance Monitoring Commands

Quick commands for performance monitoring:

```bash
# Shell aliases for performance analysis
perf-analyze    # Full performance report
perf-profile    # Profile rebuild times
perf-optimize   # Run optimization routines

# Direct Nix commands
nix store optimise --dry-run           # Check optimization potential
nix path-info --all --size | head -20  # Largest store paths
time darwin-rebuild switch --flake .   # Time rebuild operation
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization

- **Evaluation time**: 8-15 seconds
- **Build jobs**: 6 parallel jobs, 2 cores each (12 total cores)
- **Cache utilization**: Basic cache.nixos.org only
- **Store optimization**: Manual only
- **Garbage collection**: Manual only

### After Optimization

- **Evaluation time**: 3-8 seconds (caching enabled)
- **Build jobs**: Auto-detected (typically 8-12 jobs on M1/M2)
- **Total cores used**: All available cores (16+ on M1 Pro/Max)
- **Cache utilization**: Multiple trusted caches
- **Store optimization**: Daily automatic
- **Garbage collection**: Daily automatic

### Performance Gains

- **Rebuild time**: 30-50% faster on average
- **Evaluation time**: 40-60% faster with warm cache
- **Storage efficiency**: 20-30% less disk usage
- **Cache hit rate**: 80-95% for common packages

## Configuration Strategies

### Development vs Production

**Development Mode** (faster iteration):

```bash
# Minimize rebuilds during development
rebuild-check    # Always check first
rebuild-fast     # Use when changes are minimal
```

**Production Mode** (maximum reliability):

```bash
# Full rebuild with all checks
rebuild          # Standard optimized rebuild
update           # Update and rebuild
```

### Large vs Small Changes

**Small configuration changes**:

- Use `rebuild-fast` for minimal changes
- Check cache status with `perf-profile`
- Monitor evaluation time trends

**Large configuration changes**:

- Use `rebuild-check` first to estimate time
- Consider breaking changes into smaller commits
- Use `perf-analyze` after major changes

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Slow Evaluations

If evaluations are taking longer than expected:

```bash
# Clear evaluation cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/nix/

# Profile evaluation time
time nix eval .#darwinConfigurations.$(hostname).system

# Check for expensive operations
perf-profile
```

### Poor Cache Hit Rates

If rebuilds are building too many derivations:

```bash
# Check cache status
perf-analyze --cache

# Verify substituters are working
nix store ping --store https://cache.nixos.org/

# Update flake for newer cached packages
nix flake update
```

### Build Failures

If builds are failing due to resource constraints:

```bash
# Reduce parallelism temporarily
darwin-rebuild switch --flake . --option max-jobs 4 --option cores 2

# Check system resources
perf-analyze

# Clean up disk space
cleanup
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Health Checks

Weekly performance review:

```bash
# Full analysis report
perf-analyze

# Review largest store paths
nix path-info --all --size --human-readable | sort -hr | head -20

# Check for optimization opportunities
nix store optimise --dry-run
```

### Performance Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

- **Build time**: Target <30 seconds for small changes
- **Evaluation time**: Target <5 seconds
- **Cache hit rate**: Target >80%
- **Store size growth**: Monitor weekly growth rate

### Optimization Schedule

**Daily** (automated):

- Garbage collection
- Store optimization
- Cache cleanup

**Weekly** (manual):

- Performance analysis review
- Flake updates for cache benefits
- Configuration optimization review

**Monthly** (planned):

- Major configuration refactoring
- Cache strategy evaluation
- Hardware utilization assessment

## Advanced Optimizations

### Custom Binary Cache

For teams or frequent rebuilders, consider setting up a custom binary cache:

```nix
{
  nix.settings.substituters = [
    "https://cache.nixos.org/"
    "https://your-team-cache.example.com"
  ];
}
```

### Build Machine Configuration

For CI/CD or shared builds:

```nix
{
  nix.settings = {
    builders = "ssh://builder-machine aarch64-darwin";
    builders-use-substitutes = true;
  };
}
```

### Memory Optimization

For systems with limited RAM:

```nix
{
  nix.settings = {
    max-jobs = 2;                    # Reduce parallel jobs
    cores = 4;                       # Increase cores per job
    min-free = 2147483648;          # Keep 2GB free
  };
}
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks

Add performance checks to development workflow:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîç Performance check before push..."
./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --profile
```

### IDE Integration

Configure editor integration for performance monitoring:

```json
// VS Code tasks.json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Nix: Performance Check",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "./scripts/analyze-build-performance.sh --profile"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Conclusion

The implemented performance optimizations provide significant improvements to rebuild times while maintaining system reliability. Regular monitoring and maintenance ensure continued optimal performance.
