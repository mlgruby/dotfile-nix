# First Steps After Installation

Congratulations! You've successfully installed your Nix Darwin dotfiles. Here's
what to do next to get the most out of your new system.

## âœ… Verify Installation

First, let's make sure everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Check if darwin-rebuild is working
darwin-rebuild --version

# Verify home-manager is active
home-manager --version

# Test your shell configuration
echo $SHELL
which zsh
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Essential First Steps

### 1. Update Your User Configuration

Your personal settings are stored in `user-config.nix`. Let's make sure
everything is correct:

```bash
# Navigate to your dotfiles
cd ~/Documents/dotfile

# Edit your user configuration
vim user-config.nix
```

**Key settings to verify:**

- `username` - Must match your macOS username
- `email` - Used for Git commits
- `githubUsername` - For GitHub integration
- `hostname` - Should match your Mac's hostname

### 2. Test Core Functionality

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
# Test Git configuration
git config --list | grep user

# Test SSH keys (if GitHub setup was completed)
ssh -T git@github.com

# Test AWS SSO (if configured)
awsl  # AWS SSO login

# Check available aliases
alias | grep -E "^(rebuild|cleanup|health)"
```

### 3. Apply Your First Rebuild

Make a small change and test the rebuild process:

```bash
# Make a rebuild to ensure everything works
rebuild

# If that succeeds, try a full system check
health-check
```

## ðŸ”§ Common Next Steps

### For Developers

```bash
# Set up development environment for your language
setup-dev-env --list

# For Python development
setup-dev-env python

# For Node.js development  
setup-dev-env nodejs
```

### For Customization Enthusiasts

```bash
# Explore available themes
ls ~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/

# Check current Starship theme
starship config

# View available fonts
fc-list | grep -i nerd
```

### For System Administrators

```bash
# Check system health
health-check

# View performance metrics
perf-analyze

# Monitor system in real-time
monitor-status
```
