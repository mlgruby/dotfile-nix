#
# Utility Packages Collection
#
# Purpose:
# - Installs essential CLI tools and utilities via Nix
# - Provides tools that don't have Home Manager program modules
# - Complements Homebrew-installed tools with Nix alternatives
#
# Package Categories:
# - Development Tools: HTTP clients, code analysis, benchmarking
# - Text Processing: Document conversion, JSON/YAML tools
# - Network Tools: Network scanning, utilities
# - Archive Tools: Compression and extraction utilities
# - System Tools: Process monitoring, file utilities
# - Modern Replacements: Enhanced versions of classic tools
#
# Philosophy:
# - Install via Nix when not available via Homebrew
# - Prefer tools with programs.* modules (configured elsewhere)
# - Avoid duplicating Homebrew-installed packages
#
# Integration:
# - Works with shell aliases (aliases.nix)
# - Compatible with development workflow
# - Supports both Nix and Homebrew ecosystems
